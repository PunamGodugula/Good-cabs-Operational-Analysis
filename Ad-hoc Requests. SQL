Generate a report that evaluates the target performance for trips at the monthly and city level. For each city and month, compare the actual
total trips with the target trips and categorise the performance as follows:

  If actual trips are less than or equal to target trips, mark it as "Below Target".

Additionally, calculate the % difference between actual and target trips to quantify the performance gap.

Generate a report that shows the percentage distribution of repeat passengers by the number of trips they have taken in each city.
Calculate the percentage of repeat passengers who took 2 trips, 3 trips, and so on, up to 10 trips.

Each column should represent a trip count category, displaying the percentage of repeat passengers who fall into that category out of the

This report will help identify cities with high repeat trip frequency, which can indicate strong customer loyalty or frequent usage patterns.
